/**
 *
 * React
 *
 * component based architecture
 * divide the UI into reusable components
 *
 * virtual DOM
 * a lightweight copy of the actual DOM
 * if changes happen, react will first compare the previous version of the virtual DOM with the updated version of the virtual DOM,
 * find where the changes happen, after that, react will only make the necessary changes to the actual DOM
 *
 * one way data flow, parents to children
 * props (from parent component), state (is managed inside of the component)
 *
 * todolist -> todoform
 *          -> todoitem
 *
 *
 * React is an UI library
 * library vs framework
 * more flexible
 *
 *
 * react -> web dev
 * react native -> mobile dev
 *
 *
 * create-react-app
 *
 *
 * extension
 * .js  .jsx
